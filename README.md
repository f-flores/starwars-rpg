# Star Wars RPG Game

#### Fabian Flores

### Overview

The `Star Wars RPG Game` is an interactive game which dynamically updates web pages leveraging the jQuery library. The player selects an attacker and a defender. The objetive of the game is for the attacker to beat the enemy
defender. Health points, attack power, and counterattack power and choice of enemy determines who will win.

### Description

Before beginning to code, it was important to think of a data structure that would be able to neatly implement the game. An array of objects is the way I decided to represent the star war characters. Each object has the following attributes:  

1. one

2. two

3. three 

### Method

For the movement of the star war character cards, the `jQuery detach()` function came in handy. The `detach` utility allows for the object to disappear from the screen without destroying its contents.
